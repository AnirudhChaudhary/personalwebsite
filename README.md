# Anirudh Chaudhary's Personal Website

This personal website is a side project that I am working on to learn about web design and to document different parts of my life that I want to share with people that are interested.

Current:
Just beginning to learn about the foundations of html and css

Future Goals / Ambitions:
- Create different pages with different background pictures (topical theme).
- Introduce and implement cool web design features.
- Document things that I have learned through my different experiences.
- Host this website with a different domain.
